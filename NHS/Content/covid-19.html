                What is COVID-19?<br />
                COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and
                ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’
                The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
                Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.

                What are the symptoms of COVID-19?<br />
                Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause
                pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These symptoms are similar to
                the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing
                is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19.

                How does COVID-19 spread?<br />
                The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated
                through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces
                contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may
                survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.
